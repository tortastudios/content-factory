## 9. Advanced Content Prompts

### Headline Generator (Professional Method)

```
I recently came up with an idea for content: [YOUR SEED IDEA]

Here are my goals:
- [GOAL 1: e.g., Drive newsletter signups]
- [GOAL 2: e.g., Target startup founders]
- [GOAL 3: e.g., Leverage current trend]

Additional context: [YOUR AUDIENCE/PLATFORM CONTEXT]

Generate 20 potential headlines that:
- Create curiosity gaps
- Include specific numbers where relevant
- Promise tangible benefits
- Are optimized for [PLATFORM]

Under each headline, list 3-5 main points that would make up the content.

Prioritize:
- Specificity over cleverness
- Tangible outcomes over vague promises
- Emotional triggers that drive shares
- Headlines that would make YOU click
```

### Viral Hook Adapter

```
I want to adapt a proven viral hook to a new topic.

ORIGINAL VIRAL HOOK:
[PASTE HIGH-PERFORMING HOOK]

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
[e.g., 50K likes, 2K retweets]

NEW TOPIC TO APPLY:
[YOUR NEW SUBJECT]

Analyze the architecture of the original hook (not the content):
1. Emotional triggers used
2. Structural elements
3. Curiosity gap creation
4. Pacing and rhythm

Then create:
1. One adapted version for my new topic
2. Five additional variations maintaining the same psychological triggers
3. Platform-specific optimizations for Twitter vs LinkedIn

Remember: We're stealing the architecture, not the content.
```

### Content Section Builder

```
I'm writing about: [YOUR TOPIC]
Main point: [SPECIFIC SECTION FOCUS]

I want to deliver value using: [CHOOSE: Tips/Stats/Steps/Lessons/Examples/Mistakes/Benefits/Reasons/Habits/Stories]

Generate 5-7 [CHOSEN FORMAT] that are:
- Ultra-specific and tangible
- Immediately actionable
- Include concrete numbers/examples
- Written in sentence format (not just bullets)
- Could be implemented today

For each point:
1. Make it specific enough to pass the "so what?" test
2. Include proof or evidence
3. Add one-sentence elaboration that increases value
4. Order from most compelling to least

Quality standard: Each point should make the reader think "I never thought of it that way" or "I need to try this immediately."
```

### Mini-Model Creator

```
I want to train you to write in my specific style.

STEP 1 - Here's high-performing content I created:
[PASTE YOUR SUCCESSFUL CONTENT]

STEP 2 - Here's my attempt at similar content:
[PASTE YOUR ATTEMPT AT SIMILAR PIECE]

STEP 3 - Based on these examples, analyze:
1. My vocabulary patterns and word choices
2. How I structure content
3. My pacing and rhythm
4. Emotional triggers I use
5. How I deliver value

STEP 4 - Generate 3 new pieces on [NEW TOPIC] that:
- Match my exact voice and style
- Use similar structural patterns
- Maintain the same emotional appeal
- Apply to these topics: [LIST TOPICS]

After you generate these, I'll tell you which works best so you can refine the model.
```

### Quality Optimization Prompt

```
Review this content for professional quality standards:

[PASTE YOUR CONTENT]

Apply the systematic evaluation approach:

1. IMMEDIATE VALUE CHECK:
   - Is the value clear immediately?
   - Would someone know what they'll learn?
   - Is it compelling enough to continue reading?

2. SPECIFICITY ASSESSMENT:
   - Are benefits specific, not vague?
   - Include concrete numbers/examples?
   - Could someone act on this today?

3. FLOW EVALUATION:
   - Most compelling content front-loaded?
   - Each section maintains attention?
   - Clear progression of value?

4. THE AUTHENTICITY TEST:
   - Conversational, not corporate?
   - Includes personal specificity?
   - Sounds like a human wrote it?

For any elements that fail these tests:
1. Identify the specific issue
2. Provide 2 improved alternatives
3. Explain why the new version works better

Goal: Content that requires minimal editing and sounds authentically personal.
