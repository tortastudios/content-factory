## 1. Headline Generation Mega-Prompt

```
I recently came up with an idea for an 800-word article: [YOUR_SEED_IDEA]

AUTHOR CONTEXT:
[INSERT: business-context.yaml - positioning and value_proposition]
[INSERT: audience-profile.yaml - target_audience and pain_points]

Here are the goals of the piece I want to write:
- [GOAL 1: Connect to [INSERT: business-context.yaml - core_services]]
- [GOAL 2: Actionable for [INSERT: audience-profile.yaml - primary_audience]]
- [GOAL 3: Leverage [INSERT: brand-voice.yaml - signature_elements]]

VOICE REQUIREMENTS:
[INSERT: brand-voice.yaml - primary_traits and key_phrases_that_work]

Can you please generate 20 potential headlines for this piece? Under each headline, list out 3-5 main points that would make up the content of that piece.

Focus on:
- Tangible benefits over clever wordplay
- Specific numbers and outcomes where relevant
- Headlines that create curiosity gaps using [INSERT: brand-voice.yaml - hook_types]
- Clear value propositions aligned with [INSERT: business-context.yaml - objectives]
```

## 2. Hook Template Adaptation System

### The Viral Hook Transformer

```
I want to adapt a viral content structure to a new topic while maintaining [AUTHOR_NAME]'s voice.

ORIGINAL HOOK THAT WENT VIRAL:
[PASTE THE ORIGINAL HOOK HERE]

NEW TOPIC I WANT TO APPLY IT TO:
[YOUR NEW TOPIC/IDEA]

VOICE CONTEXT:
[INSERT: brand-voice.yaml - signature_elements and conversational_authenticity]
[INSERT: brand-voice.yaml - critical_avoids - what NOT to include]

Please:
1. First, analyze the structure and architecture of the original hook (not the content)
2. Create an adapted version using the same structure for my new topic
3. Apply [INSERT: brand-voice.yaml - voice_implementation guidelines]
4. Generate 5 additional variations maintaining [AUTHOR_NAME]'s authentic voice

Remember: We're borrowing the architecture, not the content. Focus on:
- Maintaining [INSERT: brand-voice.yaml - balance_points]
- Keeping [INSERT: brand-voice.yaml - engagement_triggers] emotional triggers
- Preserving curiosity gap structure appropriate for [INSERT: audience-profile.yaml - target_audience]
- Using [INSERT: brand-voice.yaml - specific_vivid_details] when possible
```

## 3. Section Development Prompt

I need to develop a specific section of content that maintains [AUTHOR_NAME]'s voice.
