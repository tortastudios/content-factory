# Content Prompts Collection - Anonymized Templates

This directory contains professional-grade content creation prompts and templates designed for AI-assisted content creation. These prompts are based on proven methodologies and integrate with a context-profile system for personalized, authentic content generation.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Create Your Context Profiles
Use the **context-profile-helper.md** prompt with your AI assistant to create four essential YAML files:

- **brand-voice.yaml** - Your unique voice characteristics, tone, and style
- **audience-profile.yaml** - Your target audience demographics, needs, and preferences  
- **business-context.yaml** - Your company positioning, services, and objectives
- **story-bank.yaml** - Your personal experiences, anecdotes, and examples

The helper will guide you through detailed questions to build comprehensive profiles that capture your authentic voice and business context.

### Step 2: Populate Content Prompts
Once you have your YAML profiles, use any prompt from this collection by replacing placeholder syntax like `[INSERT: brand-voice.yaml - signature_elements]` with the actual content from your context profiles.

### Step 3: Generate Consistent Content
Copy the populated prompts into ChatGPT, Claude, or your preferred AI system for authentic, audience-aligned content generation.
